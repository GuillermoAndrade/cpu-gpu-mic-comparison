## CPU-GPU-MIC Comparison Charts

This is the data repository supplementing my blog post comparing hardware characteristics of CPUs, GPUs, and MICs:

### Replot the Figures: 

 - Linux, MacOS: Run `build.sh` from your terminal (Gnuplot is required) â€“ `./build.sh`. EPS figures are generated.
   * Call `./build.sh --png` to convert the EPS figures into PNG pictures. ImageMagick needs to be installed for this.
   * Call `./build.sh --pdf` to convert the EPS figures into PDF graphics. `epstopdf` (from a LaTeX installation) is used for this.
 
 - Windows: Install gnuplot, then load the *.gnuplot files to recreate the figures (untested). You may need to install postscript or change the Gnuplot terminal to png.

ImageMagick changed its security policy. You may need to enable EPS or PDF in the policy file.
